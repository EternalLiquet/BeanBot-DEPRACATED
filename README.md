# BeanBot
This is the code behind the discord bot for the Illinois Livers server

One of the the primary intentions of this bot is to provide an automated way to verify new members to give them student roles. 
The secondary intent of this bot is to provide a gacha style game based on cards on schoolido.lu's API. 
And finally, the final (current) intent of this bot is to provide more sophistication to meetup information and RSVPing
